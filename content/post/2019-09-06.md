> **Trevor Davies** (@optimlog_; 0/2): #epitwitter #rstats please let me know if I'm out of my mind. If you designed an RCT to see an absolute reduction of 30% in an outcome, then the reported MOA should be on the difference scale, right?! And the minimum detectable effect size should be reported on that same scale  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/dataandme/status/1169725270879698944)
